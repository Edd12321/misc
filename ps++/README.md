ps++
====
Very simple "tool" for executing pseudocode directly from Romanian BAC exam documents. It allows you to just copy and paste the pseudocode directly into a file/pipe it to stdin, and it can produce the equivalent C++ file, and potentially execute it.

Note: Unspecified behaviour happens when syntax is invalid. This should not be treated as a full transpiler.
